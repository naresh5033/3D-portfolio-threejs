# Portfolio 2

This is my second portfolio, what's new in this is gon be a 3d website with the three js, react library (React three fibre), Framer motion(also used in my prev portfolio proj), tailwind css and email js.

# set up

- ```npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react```
- ``` npm i -D tailwindcss``` and ```npx tailwindcss init``` 
- and for the packages ```npm i --legacy-peer-deps @react-three/fribre @react-three/drei maath react-tilt react-vertical-timeline-component @emailjs/browser framer-motion react-router-dom ``` (since we re using the react-tilt which is the older version of react so ve to use the legacy peer flag)
